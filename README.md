# SM213 Simulator in SourcePawn

This is an [SM213](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/213-10/resources/isa.pdf) assembly compiler and simulator ported to SourcePawn with additions for controlling bots on the server for experimental purposes written roughly back in 2016.

See the `asm` folder for examples.
